                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">There are 33,127 entries in the database of opera performances that makes up the foundation of this project. However, each entry refers to at least one performance, and in one case, as many as 71 (Rossini's <em>L'italiana in Algeri</em>, performed in Hamburg, Germany, during the 2013-2014 season), so the actual number of performances contained in this database is much, much more than 33,127 - closer to 142,000, in fact.&nbsp;<br><br>What can we do with such a large database of opera performances? In this project, I aim to use the information contained within to uncover trends about gender and nationalism and to explore whether The Canon is still as canonical as it has historically been. In short, do DWGs (dead white guys) still rule the world of opera? This issue has been a topic of discussion in the classical music world since at least the 1970s when <a href="https://gap.hks.harvard.edu/orchestrating-impartiality-impact-%E2%80%9Cblind%E2%80%9D-auditions-female-musicians" class="text-primary" target="_blank"><u>orchestras began using blind auditions</u></a> and found that the number of women they hired increased. It sparked conversation about how implicit (or explicit) bias against women and minorities might be keeping the classical music world #sowhite. In the last forty years, some progress has been made, but despite the optics of concerts dedicated to women and minority composers, changing the field of Western classical music is like trying to turn an aircraft carrier - the canon seems to persist. This is especially true with opera, which has struggled to remain relevant into the twenty-first century. This project is an attempt to quantify the canon and see just how much progress has actually been made. (Spoiler alert - not much.)<br><br>The dataset that this project is built on was originally collected from <a href="https://www.operabase.com/en" class="text-primary" target="_blank"><u>operabase.com</u></a> by Alexander Cuntz, from the World Intellectual Property Organization, who used the data to <a href="https://www.wipo.int/publications/en/details.jsp?id=4521" class="text-primary" target="_blank"><u>study what effect copyright has</u></a> on how frequently a work is performed. The records encompass six seasons (2012-2013 through 2017-2018) and are global in scope. Performances are separated by city rather than by company, so it is not clear whether the data includes both national and local companies. It is also not clear whether this is an exhaustive database or whether there are missing performances that might skew the results. Moreover, there are the common issues with gender and nationality designations that we always run into when trying to classify something that defies boundaries (gender exists on a spectrum, and nationalities are arbitrary and can't account for people - or borders - that move). Nevertheless, the conclusions I draw are significant enough that I feel comfortable standing by them, until new observations require adjustment.<br><br>To prepare the dataset for this project, I used OpenRefine to concatenate the six separate seasons into a single file. I then changed the country codes to the full names of the countries (transliterated to English) for readability, and I split out the dates of birth and death into separate columns for Month, Day, and Year so that I could categorize composers into eras of music history based on their birth years. Where information was missing about a composer's nationality, I did my best to fill in the blanks through research. Certain categories, like "Work Nationality" and "Work Type" were not relevant to the findings and were left untouched.<br><br>I used Tableau to create the visualizations in this project. I was able to do all of the graphs from the original, cleaned dataset, except for two. One was the visualization about the percentage of native composers programmed by a country. For this graphic, I used Excel's pivot table function to extract the data into a new spreadsheet and ran a calculation to get the percentage. This was then uploaded to Tableau to create the visualization. The other issue was with the graphic about second most popular nationalities per country. For this, I had to create a subset from an existing Tableau visualization, copy it into Excel, then re-upload it as its own data source in Tableau. I used the union function to connect the two datasets, which allowed me to make a graph from the subset using calculations contained in the main dataset. The analysis is presented in narrative form, but most of the visualizations are interactive so you can mouse over them to get more information. Some allow you to filter to see your own results. Due to the size of the project, I did not break down my analyses by season. Rather, I created a set of maps hosted on the Maps page that will allow you to see broad trends across seasons. These trends mirror the outcomes I got from the larger set.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Dataset Citation:</strong>&nbsp;Cuntz, Alexander, 2020, "Replication Data for: Grand rights and opera reuse today", <a href="https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/8LUFN8" class="text-primary" target="_blank"><u>https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/8LUFN8</u></a>, Harvard Dataverse, V1</p>
