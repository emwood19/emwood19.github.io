                    This is a complex and nuanced topic. Like all art, opera has on the one hand been created as an expression of its composer, and on the other hand been appropriated by the state or society to advance a cause. Wagner (1813-1883) is famously associated with Hitler's Germany, even though the composer died before Hitler was even born. This was due somewhat to Wagner's anti-Semitism and the nationalistic messaging in operas like <em>Die Meistersinger</em>&nbsp;and <em>Parsifal</em>, but also to a desire to claim and exalt the composer as a symbol of German Greatness at a time when Germany had lost its status as a world power (the same conditions that gave rise to Hitler). [1] Another example: Russia in the early 1900s had a complicated relationship to opera - it was seen as a bourgeois art form, especially with its connection to Italy, France, and Germany; yet in the search for a national music as part of Stalin's cultural policy, Russian composers were encouraged to create Russian operas as a symbol of the importance of Soviet unity. [2] More recently, scholars have written about a resurgence in Hungarian nationalism through revival of the works of one of the most famous and important Hungarian composers of the nineteenth century, Ferenc Erkel (1810-1893). The Hungarian National Opera chose Erkel's work <em>Bánc bán</em>&nbsp;as the primary piece for their 2018 tour to New York City, their first tour to the US, as a display of national pride. [3]<br><br>It is against this back drop that I examine the nationalities of the composers represented in the dataset. There are two main approaches we could take. First, we could look just at the nationalities of the composers in the set and see which nationalities are most represented.&nbsp;</p>

                    This chart shows the highest numbers of nationalities. The suspected leaders are indeed the most frequent - Italian, Austrian, German, French, Russian, and British - indicating that composers from those countries are still the most popular. However, this is a very surface-level analysis. A more interesting question is: which countries have programmed the most works by native composers?</p>

                    This chart shows the countries who programmed the highest percentage of native composers. Italy is far and away the country that programmed the most works by Italian composers, which is not surprising since Italy is so closely associated with opera. After Italy, though, things get more interesting. Russia is next (recall the discussion in the introduction about Russian nationalism during the early twentieth century), followed by a number of countries that one might not associate with opera: Armenia, Thailand, Iceland, Azerbaijan, Mongolia. In fact, nearly every country programmed at least one native composer - only 15 countries programmed no native composers.&nbsp;<br><br>The reason countries that are not closely associated with opera show up higher on this chart is because those countries did not program many operas, but of the ones they did, a greater portion were written by native composers. This indicates that while opera may not be as popular in those countries, there is an effort to buck the canon when opera <em>is</em>&nbsp;performed - an acceptance of the art form but not the composers, perhaps. <br><br>But perhaps not. In Thailand, for instance, only 6 operas were performed, 2 of which were written by Thai-American composers, but those operas included a Verdi and a Wagner. In fact, every single country performed at least one work by Beethoven, Handel, Mozart, Puccini, Rossini, Strauss, Verdi, or Wagner.</p>
